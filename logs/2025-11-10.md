**Focus:** Multiple Linear Regression & 

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Dummy variables (Columns) : the "translation" from string categories into a numerical format the model understands.
  - quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (categorical)
  - multicollinearity : causing Dummy Variable Trap.

- Vectorirzation : faster (Extremely Fast) than non-vectored approach such as Loop(Very slow). Vectorization is so fast because it utlize the parallalism approach of CPU and GPU.

## 💻 Snippet / Command

```py
import numpy as np

w = np.array([0.2, 0.5, -0.1])
b = 1.0
x = np.array([10, 20, 30])

# The entire calculation is done in one line
prediction = np.dot(w, x) + b 

# prediction will be 10.0
```

⚠️ Speed-Bump / Question

- cannot understand why multicollinearity.
