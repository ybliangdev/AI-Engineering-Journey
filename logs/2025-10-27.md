**Focus:** Query Understanding (NLP) Module Design - Intent Recognition

## üß† What I Learned

- Intent Recognition: `spaCy`vs `NLTK`
  - Named Entity Recognition: Entities in text are specific pieces of information like names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and quantities that have a specific meaning
  - spaCy is a free, open-source Python library that provides advanced capabilities to conduct natural language processing (NLP) on large volumes of text at high speed.
  - A spaCy pipeline is a series of processing steps for turning raw text into a structured object filled with linguistic information
- Measure SpaCy's model Accuracy:
  1. Using the spacy evaluate CLI Command
  2. Using the nlp.evaluate() Method in Code

## üíª Snippet / Command

```py
import spacy
from spacy.training import Example

# Load your model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# This is your "gold-standard" test data
# (text, annotations_dict)
TEST_DATA = [
    ("Who is Shigeru Miyamoto?", {"entities": [(7, 24, "PERSON")]}),
    ("I like Nintendo games.", {"entities": [(7, 15, "ORG")]})
]

# Convert the test data to Example objects
examples = []
for text, annots in TEST_DATA:
    doc = nlp.make_doc(text)
    examples.append(Example.from_dict(doc, annots))

# The nlp.evaluate() method scores the model on the examples
scores = nlp.evaluate(examples)

# The 'scores' dict contains detailed results
print(f"NER F-score: {scores['ents_f']:.2f}")
print(f"NER Precision: {scores['ents_p']:.2f}")
print(f"NER Recall: {scores['ents_r']:.2f}")

outputs:
NER F-score: 0.50 // The harmonic mean of precision and recall. This is the main score for NER.
NER Precision: 0.50 //Of all the entities the model found, how many were correct?
NER Recall: 0.50 //Of all the actual entities, how many did the model find?
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Speed-Bump / Question

- What are F-score, Recall?
- What is Fine-grained (tag)?
