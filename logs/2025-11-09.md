**Focus:** Gradient Descent

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum value of a function. Gradient descent is a training-only algorithm.

- Gradient descent challange: local minimum vs global minium
  - Solution: using STOCHASTIC Gradient Descent (SGD)
  - Random initilization & multiple trail

- In gradient descent, the learning rate is a small number that controls how big of a step you take to get down the hill (the cost function).  
  - Choosing the right learning rate is a trade-off. It directly controls both the speed and the success of your model's training.
  - A good learning rate takes confident steps large enough to make progress quickly, but small enough that it doesn't overshoot the lowest point. The Result: The model finds the minimum error efficiently. This is called convergence.

- Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:
  - Uses a small group (a "mini-batch") of training samples (e.g., 32, 64, or 128 samples) to calculate the gradient for a single step.

### AWS

- VPC: Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud environment, free from the limitations of physical network infrastructure.

- IAM: Identity could be person or services

- Amazon Resource Name (ARN): ARNs are most commonly used in IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies to grant or deny specific permissions.
format: arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource
e.g. IAM user: `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/JohnDoe`
EC2 instance: `arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-01a2b3c4d5e6f7`
