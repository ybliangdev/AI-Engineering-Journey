## 🧠 What I Learned

- Mlflow is primarily for one thing: tracking model performance. You create an “experiment” that captures each “run” of the training loop where you can log how your model performs. In addition to logging metrics, you can log the model to be registered in a deployment environment, log model parameters, any transformers (scalers, encoders, etc), and visualizations such as shap feature importance visuals, or training loss graphs.

- Feast: An open source product. Its main job is to manage the data (called "features") that you feed into your machine learning models. It acts as a bridge between data engineering (where data is created) and machine learning (where data is used).
  - What Problems Does Feast Solve?

    Solves Training-Serving Skew: By using Feast to generate both training data (from the offline store) and inference data (from the online store), you guarantee consistency and improve model performance.
  - Standardizes ML Pipelines: 
  
    It creates a clear, standardized workflow for how features are created, stored, and consumed, making your entire MLOps process more reliable and scalable.

  - Provides Low-Latency Serving: 
    
    It provides a highly optimized system for serving features to live models in production, which is something very difficult to build from scratch.

- Training-Serving Skew: training-serving skew is when your model's performance in production (serving) is worse than it was during testing (training).This happens because the data the model sees in the real world is different from the data you used to train it.
