**Focus:** Normalization & library contractions

## 🧠 What I Learned

- contractions.fix("I'll be there.") → "I will be there."/ contractions.fix("y'all") → "you all"

- Why contractions Is Used in NLP
  - Text Standardization: It ensures that words with the same meaning are represented in the same way. For example, a model would see "it's" and "it is" as two completely different words.
  - Improves Tokenization:Expanding contractions ensures that "shouldn't" is split into "should" and "not" rather than "shouldn" and "t".
  - Reduces Vocabulary Size: By converting all variations ("it's", "It's") to a single form ("it is"), you reduce the total number of unique words the model needs to learn, which can improve its performance.

- contractions.add(): You can add your own custom contraction rules to the library's dictionary at runtime.

  ```py
  # Add a custom rule (e.g., domain-specific slang)
  contractions.add('idk', 'I do not know')
  text = "idk what that means."
  print(contractions.fix(text))
  # Output: I do not know what that means.
  ```

- The `pycontractions` Library : This is a more advanced, context-aware library. It uses language models (like GloVe or Word2Vec) to intelligently guess the correct expansion for ambiguous contractions (like "he's" -> "he is" vs. "he has").

## 💻 Snippet / Command

```py
# 1. Define your "API" (the dictionary)
CONTRACTION_MAP = {
    "it's": "it is",
    "I'm": "I am",
    "you'll": "you will",
    "don't": "do not"
    # ... and so on
}

# 2. "Call" your API
text = "I'm sure it's fine."
words = text.split()
expanded_words = []

for word in words:
    # Use .get() to return the word itself if not found in the map
    expanded_words.append(CONTRACTION_MAP.get(word, word))

expanded_text = ' '.join(expanded_words)
print(expanded_text)
# Output: I am sure it is fine.
```

⚠️ Speed-Bump / Question

> When should I use contraction, contraction-fix, pycontractions and manual custom dictionaries?

The short answer is:

contractions: Your simple, lightweight default for most scripts.

contraction-fix: When contractions is too slow and you need high-speed batch processing.

pycontractions: The heavyweight, high-accuracy choice when context matters (e.g., "he's" vs. "he has").

Manual Dictionary: When you have very specific, non-standard text (like internal jargon or gaming slang) and need total control.
