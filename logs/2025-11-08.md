**Focus:** ML basic: cost function formula

## 🧠 What I Learned

### Cost functions

- cost function in machine learning is a formula that measures the "cost" or **error** of a model. 

- The main goal during model training is to find the parameters (weights and biases) that minimize this cost function.

- The most common cost function for regression is the *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*. However, for classification, you can't use MSE because the prediction is a probability (between 0 and 1). Instead, the most common cost function is Log Loss, also known as **Binary Cross-Entropy**.

### AWS

- Day 1 Checklist for Your New AWS Account:

  - Understand what is AWS free tier: 
  
    - some services are not free after 12 months, setup a reminder on your phone.

    - some services have limited usuage.

    - some services are just a few months free trial.

    - Always Free Components. It is possible to build app using complete free components in AWS as long as it is not pass the threshold.
  
  - Dicth Root Account immediately, do not use it on daily basis.
    
    - Root account is the registered email account  

    - Enable 2FA such as Google Authenticator for Root and User accounts

    - AWS Cli is required for some services, but it is a easy setup

    - Enable billing alert notification: whenver dollar is exceed the limit, you got the email.

## 💻 Snippet / Command

```py
# list slice syntax:
# my_list[start:stop:step]
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
letters[:3]
output:
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

⚠️ Speed-Bump / Question

- How to log any AWS Root Account actitity such as when there is a login, an email notification will be sent.

- How to deal with getting the notifications during mid night?
